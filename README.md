## Description

The goal of this project was to implement a file system server that allowed concurrent user accesses while maintaining a coherent state. The general structure of the file system follows the Unix File System family, while the project itself is implemented in C. This project includes the implementation of the FS, of the server to client datagram socket communication, of the locking logic and also of the client side API, alongside multiple test files and a script or two to run them. Further information can be read on the provided project description PDF files.
